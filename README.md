# PHSX815_Week8

## HW8 
* Write code for a simple model with at least one parameter (like coin probability, normal distr. mean, etc.) and an observable related to that parameter

* Create a figure of the "Neyman Construction" (see March 23 lecture), i.e. make a 2D plot with "true" parameter value on the x-axis and "measured" value on the y-axis, sampling many random experiments for each true value 

* `python Neyman_construction.py`


## HW9 

* Write a program that can find the minimum of a function that you define. 

* We are minimizing function `f(x) = sin(x)*(x-1)^2`

* see jupyter notebook `minimize.ipynb`
